  Standard X11 layout switcher is activated immediately by pressing the keys and therefore conflicts with the application shortcuts.
  This switcher is activated by releasing the keys, but only under the condition that no other key is pressed. For example, You were asked to switch to the layout 2 by RCtrl. Then if You press and release RCtrl, the layout will be switched. But if You pressed in a text editor RCtrl-Right, then the editor performs jump forward a word and layout will not be switched.

  If You need a layout indicator, You can use a standard X11 LED indicator or any tray indicator as xxkb.

                    Example

  I use 3 layouts: (us,ru,ua), LED "ScrollLock" as indicator and keys following: RShift sets "us", RCtrl sets "ru" and RWin sets "ua". On the pc105 keyboard these keys have the keycodes 62, 105 and 134.

  In the X11 keyboard config (in my ArchLinux it is the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-keyboard-layout.conf) I define:

        Option "XkbLayout" "us, ru, ua"
        Option "XkbOptions" "grp_led:scroll"

  In the autostart I call this program:

        xkbs1kls 62 105 134 &
